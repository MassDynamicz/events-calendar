# Events calendar with PHP and FullCalendar javascript library

The calendar allows adding, editing, and deleting events. The code also includes the use of AJAX requests and generating a random color for each new event. Additionally, the code includes a function to determine whether the background color is light or dark in order to correctly select the text color for the event based on the background color.

To connect the calendar, you need to create a database and upload the tbl_events table
